# Final-Porject

Of course! Here is the translated text:

I am very happy to deliver this website because I made it with a lot of effort and dedication. All the work displayed on this site is mine, created over several years of experience as a graphic designer. When I started this course, I didn't understand much about web development, but thanks to the incredible professors, I feel that I have learned a lot. I am aware that I still have a long way to go and that everything is built through practice. I hope to continue growing in this beautiful process to become a web designer someday.
